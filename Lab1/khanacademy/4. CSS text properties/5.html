    <!-- First blog post -->
    <h2 id="post1">First Post: Introduction to Hiragana</h2>
    <p>In this post, I start my journey by learning Hiragana, the first of the three Japanese scripts. Hiragana consists of 46 basic characters, and it's used for native Japanese words. Learning Hiragana is crucial because it's the foundation for understanding the language's phonetics and grammar.</p>


    <h2 id="post2">Second Post: Mastering Katakana</h2>
    <p>In my second post, I focus on Katakana, which is used to write foreign words and loanwords. It also consists of 46 characters, and though it looks different from Hiragana, learning it opens up more possibilities to read and write Japanese effectively. Katakana is essential for beginners who want to read signs, menus, and names in Japan.</p>
