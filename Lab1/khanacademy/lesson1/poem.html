    <h1>World Peace.</h1>
    <p>When wars and conflicts totally cease,<br>
In our world, there shall be peace.<br>
People must learn to get along,<br>
Not blame others, for being wrong.<br> <br>
They fight for control, fight for land,<br>
Some just need a helping hand.<br>
We must rid ourselves of vanity,<br>
And embrace peace, through humanity. <br>  <br>
Wars make children so much tougher,<br>
Lose their innocence, while they suffer.<br>
We should fight for peace instead,<br>
Love not war, we should spread.</p>
